# TrueScan3D
The poor man's 3d scanner system

## Purpose
3D Scanners are expensive, but they are a critical tool for reverse engineering obsolete parts. Many phones, such as the iPhone with it's TrueDepth front-facing camera, has the ability to generate 3D scans without all of the hastle of buying an expensive 3D scanner. TrueScan3D is a system that is designed to turn your phone into a 3D scanner by slowly rotating it around the work piece in a way which maintains dimensional accuracy. There are phone apps which let you scan objects, but you have to hold the phone with your hand which can result in artifacts that are detrimental to a good scan. This project is designed to assist in the process of using the phone as a 3D scanner.

## What is included

TrueScan3D is a collection of CAD drawings, stereolithography files, wiring diagrams, and arduino sketches designed to provide users with a functionally complete DIY 3D scanner platform. Some of the parts you have to purchase, but many of the parts can be customized and printed with your own 3D printer. 

## Contribution

This project is available free of charge, but you are welcome to contribute by helping create the project. This project will provide the base for which people can build from. I will be designing this platform so that in can be easily printed and used to scan parts which would print on my AnyCubic Mega Pro, but if you have a printer that uses different build dimensions then you can fork this project and redesign it to fit your printer!
